Here are his favorites:\n\n🧠 **AttentioFlow AI** - A PyTorch-powered system that predicts when you're about to get distracted and nudges you back on track. Real-time inference, custom neural networks, the whole deal.\n\n📱 **Fetch Prototype** - Built a product demo so good, he presented it directly to the CEO and Chief of Staff. Talk about shipping fast!\n\n👽 **UFO Sightings Analysis** - Because who doesn't want to analyze 80,000+ UFO reports with NLP? K-Means clustering, sentiment analysis, the works.\n\nWhich one sounds interesting?",
